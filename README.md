# Machine Learning-based Digitalization of Engineering Drawings

This repository presents a hybrid method as a complete solution for digitizing engineering drawings

The architecture combines 
You Only Look Once (YOLO), Probabilistic Hough Transform (PHT), Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), and Ruled-based methods.
