# Machine Learning-based Digitalization of Engineering Drawings

This repository presents a hybrid method as a complete solution for digitizing engineering drawings

The architecture combines the
You Only Look Once (**YOLO**), Probabilistic Hough Transform (**PHT**), Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (**DBSCAN**), and ruled-based methods.

YOLO is used for object detection, the PHT with DBSCAN is considered for segment detection, and the ruled-based methods apply considering the schematic rules of the drawings.
