The sliding windows method creates a sub-dataset that contains 640 by 640-pixel images.
The number of images depends on the size of the original drawing, as the original projects can have different sizes.

In this pre-processing phase, [artificial noise](https://github.com/SFStefenon/Digital_ED/tree/main/Sliding%20Window/Artificial%20Noise) can be applied to augment the dataset.
