The graph is built in this project to connect symbols, thus reproducing the electrical connections of the circuit. Initially, the PHT-DBSCAN lines are evaluated in relation to the YOLO bounding boxes. If there is proximity between them, an edge is created connecting a symbol to a line. When two symbols are connected to the same line, a graph is created in which only symbols are considered. An example can be seen below:
