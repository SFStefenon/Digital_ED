The PHT-DBSCAN is a hybrid method that was written from scratch for segment detection. 
The method consists of detecting dashed segments using the PHT. Using the DBSCAN method, neighboring segments are clustered, resulting in a new line that is based on the union of the segments detected by the PHT.
An example of the results of using the method is presented below.
